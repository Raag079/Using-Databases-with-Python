# Using Databases with Python

Coursera "Learn to Program and Analyze Data with Python - Develop programs to gather, clean, analyze, and visualize data" specialization

This course will introduce to the basics of the Structured Query Language (SQL) as well as basic database design for storing data as part of a multi-step data gathering, analysis, and processing effort.  The course will use SQLite3 as its database. I built web crawlers and multi-step data gathering and visualization processes. I also used the D3.js library to do basic data visualization.
